Hello and welcome to my git. My name is Benoit Ferretti

You will find 3 programs and 3 specs :
get_townhall.rb ==> get_townhall_spec.rb
dark_trader.tb ==> dark_trader_spec.rb
get_deputy.rb ==> get_deputy_spec.rb

Townhall collects emails of french townhalls
Dark Trader collects cryptos and their values
Deputy collects emails of french deputies

Each one have 3 tests  = to see if we can connect to the url, if we can collect data and if we create the right array.

Have fun ! :)
